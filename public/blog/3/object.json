Goals are an important part of life; they are part of what makes life worth living in the first place.  The nature and scope of these goals can vary wildly. They can be small goals such as finishing the house chores or simply getting out of bed in the morning.  Other goals may be incredibly lofty such as starting a business, publishing a book, or becoming fluent in a foreign language."

These are two of my favorite phrases when it comes to tackling all kinds of goals, especially the very lofty, long-running ones.  Those two phrases represent a certain mindset, one that has gotten me through most long-running goals I have had in life.  It is a mindset that has done a lot for me in general."

It is important to pay attention to the process; appreciating each and every incremental step you take on that journey toward accomplishing that goal.  Another one of my favorite quotes comes to mind here: \"How do you eat an elephant?  One bite at a time!\"  It’s necessary to ditch the \"I’ll be happy when...\" mentality and substitute it with \"I’m glad I made progress today.\""

This is a surefire way to cause one to fall into a depressing grind and lose direction.  It’s important to balance both.  Again... fall in love with the process, but don’t lose sight of the end goal.  Celebrate the small, incremental wins so you can celebrate the end result.  Stop and smell the flowers once in a while, but don’t forget where you’re going."
